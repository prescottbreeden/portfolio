        <p class="about__blurb">I'm a full-stack software developer with a background in the arts and sciences. As a former opera singer, then CEO and then neuro&shy;scientist, the one consistency across all realms was the need for newer and better tech to drive innovation. I love to think big and have a passion for tackling challenges to find elegant solutions that are clean, efficient and reusable.</p>
